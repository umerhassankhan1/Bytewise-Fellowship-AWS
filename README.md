# Bytewise-Fellowship-AWS

I learned about many AWS services including IAM, EC2, VPC, S3, Lambda, Route 53, and others during my learning process in the AWS track. The use of these services is crucial while using cloud computing. All of this information was obtained via Stephane's training, which was really beneficial. I was able to use my knowledge by deploying my resume on an S3 bucket at the conclusion of the training.
IAM (Identity and Access Management), which aids in controlling user access and permissions on AWS, was the first thing I learned. This makes it simpler for me to maintain security and regulate who can do what in my AWS environment. I then learned about EC2, a cloud computing platform that offers virtual servers. I developed and managed these servers, which aided in the deployment of programmes and the hosting of websites.
After that I learned about AWS's VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), which enables you to build private networks. I gained knowledge on how to configure safe networks, control routing, and manage resource access.
I also learned about S3 (Simple Storage Service), a platform for cloud-based file storage. I gained knowledge on how to make storage buckets, upload and download data, and control who can access the files.
Another service I learned about Lambda, a service that allows you to run code without having to manage servers. I learned how to make events that can launch functions, such as when a file is uploaded to S3.
Additionally, I became aware of Route 53, a service for controlling domain names and directing traffic to other resources. I gained knowledge about how to register domain names, set up DNS, and make sure websites are accessible.
Finally, I deployed my resume on an S3 bucket to put everything I had learned into practise. My résumé is on a straightforward website I made and hosted on AWS. This gave me the chance to show off my abilities and put what I had learned into practise. 
Overall, I learned a lot about these crucial AWS services through Stephane's course and the AWS track. I gained knowledge about controlling user access, setting up virtual servers, securing networks, storing files in the cloud, executing code without servers, controlling domain names, and deploying websites. A wonderful way for me to put my skills to use and demonstrate my abilities was to deploy my résumé on an S3 bucket.
